"""The pull request check: you may not change a skill without releasing it.

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Every version in the index names a commit, and the
build re-digests that commit's tree, so nothing unsigned is ever published.
But a pull request could still edit ``skills/nyedis/work/SKILL.md`` and
change nothing else: the build would stay green, because the index would go
on pointing at the last RELEASED commit, and the repository and the catalog
would quietly disagree about what that skill says. Somebody reading the
folder on GitHub would be reading text nobody can install.

SO A DIFF THAT TOUCHES A SKILL FOLDER MUST ALSO TOUCH THAT SKILL'S RELEASES.
The pairing is per skill, not per publisher: changing one skill does not let
you smuggle a change into another one beside it. Whether the release itself
is any good is not decided here; every release in the repository is verified
by the assemble step in the same job, and this check runs after it, so a
paired release that does not verify has already failed the build.

DELETIONS PAIR THE SAME WAY. Removing a skill folder is a change to it, and
a catalog still offering a skill whose folder is gone would hand out install
failures. The message says so rather than leaving the contributor guessing.
