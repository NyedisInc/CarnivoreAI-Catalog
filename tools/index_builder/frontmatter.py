"""The card and the front matter block, read out of a skill's SKILL.md.

A SKILL.md opens with a YAML block between two ``---`` lines. The app shows
the description before anything is installed, so it has to come out of the
skill's own text rather than out of a field somebody typed into the index:
an index that could say anything about a skill would be a place to lie
about one.

NOTHING IS INVENTED HERE. A skill with no description is REFUSED, because
"" in the index would render as a card with nothing on it and the reader
could not tell an empty description from a build that dropped the field.
