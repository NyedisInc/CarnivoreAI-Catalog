"""The four commands the workflow runs, and what each one refuses.

Run as ``python -m index_builder <command>`` from the ``tools`` directory.

  assemble  read the repository, prove every release, decide the serial and
            write an UNSIGNED index. Refuses on anything it cannot prove.
  gate      refuse a diff that edits a skill without releasing it.
  review    fill in the review block for every version, preferring a
            review already COMMITTED under reviews/ for the same bytes, then
            one the live index already published, and calling the model only
            for a version that has neither. With --handle, --name and
            --version it instead reviews ONE version and commits the artifact,
            and exits non zero when that version's verdict is blocked. With
            --from-index it instead COPIES the review this catalog already
            published for the same digest into reviews/, calling no model.
  check-reviews  refuse the build unless EVERY published version carries a
            committed review bound to its exact folder digest, and that
            review is not blocked without a written override. Holds no
            credential and calls no model, so it runs on a pull request
            from anybody.
  sign      sign the index with the key from Secrets Manager, or SKIP.
  marketplace  write, or prove fresh, the .claude-plugin/marketplace.json the
            `claude plugin marketplace add` command reads.

SECRETS ARRIVE THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT, NEVER THROUGH AN ARGUMENT. A command
line is visible in the process table and lands in a job log the moment
anything echoes it; an environment variable does neither. The two commands
that need one read it from a named variable and say, when it is missing,
which variable was empty.

    TWO SOURCES OF BYTES, AND THE VERDICT IS THE SAME EITHER WAY. With

    yet, which is the approval moment; the digest is computed from that
    folder with the same code the app uses. Without it the release
    statement is verified first and the review is bound to the digest THAT
    produced, so a review can never be committed for bytes no publisher
    signed.

    A BLOCKED VERDICT EXITS NON ZERO UNLESS A HUMAN OVERRODE IT.
    ``--override-blocked`` takes the reason, requires it to be a real
    sentence, prints the findings it is waving through and writes the
    reason, the actor and the moment into the committed artifact. IT NEVER
    CHANGES THE VERDICT: the artifact still says blocked, the card still
    marks the item, and the diff carrying the override goes past CODEOWNERS
    like every other reviewed byte.

    NOTHING IS WRITTEN WHEN THE SCAN FAILS. An unavailable review is a

    THE PUBLISH GATE, AND IT RUNS ON PULL REQUESTS. The approval gate lives
    in the script a maintainer runs on his own machine, and a gate that
    only lives in one script is a gate a hand commit walks past. This step
    reads the COMMITTED reviews for the versions the index just assembled
    and refuses the whole build unless EVERY published version carries one
    bound to its exact folder digest. It holds no cloud credential and
    calls no model, so it runs in the verify job for anybody's pull
    request, which is the thing the review job cannot do.

    THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Until 2026-09-19 an absent committed review and a
    committed review of other bytes both printed a row and passed. So an
    operator who edited the folder AFTER the staged review, or who never
    took one, published bytes nothing had approved: the build reviewed them
    and wrote the verdict into the index, which records a finding rather
    than acting on it.

    THREE WAYS TO FAIL, NAMED APART, because the operator's next move is
    different for each one:

    - ``no committed review for these bytes``: nothing under ``reviews/``
      for this version, or a file that exists and cannot be read. Review
      the bytes and commit the artifact.
    - ``committed review is for a different digest``: the folder changed
      after the review was taken. Review it again.
    - ``blocked without override``: the review read these exact bytes and
      refused them. Publish needs a written override, or different bytes.

    ONLY A COMMITTED REVIEW APPROVES BYTES. A review the LIVE INDEX carries
    for the same digest is good enough to SAVE A MODEL CALL, which is all
    rung 2 of the review step uses it for, and it is not good enough to
    ADMIT anything: the live index is the artifact this build replaces, so
    letting it approve bytes makes the gate's input its own output, and one
    bad build would then approve those bytes for every build after it. A
    committed artifact sits under ``reviews/``, which ``CODEOWNERS`` routes
    to the owner, so it reaches publication through a diff a human read.
