"""The exact bytes a publisher signs, copied from the product repo.

THIS FILE IS A COPY OF TWO RENDERERS AND THEIR FIELD SHAPES:
``release_statement`` from the product repo's ``src/models/catalog_statement.py``
and ``revoke_statement`` from its ``src/core/catalog/revocation.py``, with the
two regular expressions and the match helper they need lifted out of
``src/models/catalog.py`` so this module stands alone.

WHY A COPY AT ALL. The build job runs in this repository and cannot import
the app. The app verifies what this job publishes. So the same bytes are
rendered twice, by two programs, and one differing byte is a signature that
does not verify, which on the verifying side is indistinguishable from a
forgery. The layout is therefore spelled out line by line in both places and
a change to it is obvious in a diff.

WHAT KEEPS THE TWO HONEST. ``digest_vectors.json`` is shared byte for byte
between the two repositories and a test in each reproduces every vector, so
the DIGEST cannot drift silently. The statement layout has no such vector
file; it is guarded by being written out in full, in both files, with this
warning at the top of each. Change one and you must change the other in the
same afternoon or the catalog stops verifying.

#: A skill name. Lowercase, 1 to 64 characters, and BOTH ENDS MUST BE
#: ALPHANUMERIC. The leading rule refuses a leading dot, so ``.system``
#: can never be a name. The TRAILING rule refuses ``sme.``, which the old
#: pattern accepted: a marketplace namespace is flat and its duplicate
#: check compares names for equality, so ``sme`` and ``sme.`` are two
#: different keys, the check never fires, and the two rows are
#: indistinguishable in a list because a trailing dot reads as the end of
#: the sentence before it. Measured: a two publisher catalog emitted both
#: and the live CLI installed the trailing dot source.

#: A version. Up to four dot separated numeric components of at most nine
#: digits each, with an optional prerelease suffix that also ends
#: alphanumeric. The shape is taken from what this repository already
#: assumes rather than invented: every file under ``releases/`` is named
#: ``1.0.0.json``.
#:
#: IT WAS HELD TO NOTHING AT ALL BEFORE. A version is read from a FILE
#: STEM (``releases.py``: ``version = path.stem``), so it is attacker
#: chosen in exactly the way a name is, and ``../../../etc``, four hundred
#: digits, ``$(id)`` and a whitespace only string were all accepted and
#: signed. A twenty three digit version rendered raw in the CLI.
#:
#: IT ALSO MAKES ``VERSION_SUBJECT_SEPARATOR`` TRUE. That constant is
#: documented as not legal in a version so the revocation subject
#: ``<item_id>@<version>`` parses back unambiguously. Nothing enforced it
#: until this pattern existed, which meant a version could carry an ``@``
#: and split the subject somewhere else.
