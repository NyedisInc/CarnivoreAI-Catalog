"""The Claude plugin marketplace file, built from the same proven items.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. `claude plugin marketplace add NyedisInc/CarnivoreAI-Catalog`
reads one file, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, at the ROOT of whatever
repository was added. That file lists plugins and where each one's bytes are.
This module writes it, so the catalog is installable by the stock CLI without
anybody hand maintaining a second list of what is published.

IT IS BUILT FROM THE VERIFIED ITEMS AND FROM NOTHING ELSE. The caller hands
this module the items :mod:`index_builder.assemble` produced, which only
contain releases that survived :mod:`index_builder.releases`. A skill whose
release statement did not verify, or whose publisher has no active key, never
reaches an item and therefore can never reach this file. There is no second
walk of the `skills/` tree here, on purpose: a second walk would be a second
answer to "what is published", and the two would eventually disagree.

THE SIGNED TREE IS NOT TOUCHED. A plugin entry points straight at the skill
folder, `./skills/<handle>/<name>`, and the CLI loads a directory holding a
SKILL.md and no `skills/` subdirectory as a single skill plugin. So no
`plugin.json` is written into a skill folder and no copy of one is made
elsewhere. Either would change bytes a publisher already signed a digest
over, or duplicate them into a second tree that drifts. Proven against
Claude Code 2.1.266, which reported `Skills (1)` for exactly this shape.

THE DOCUMENT CARRIES NO TIMESTAMP AND NO SERIAL. It is a pure function of the
verified items, so two builds of the same commit write the same bytes, which
is what lets the build job tell a stale committed file from a fresh one. A
`generated_at` here would make every rebuild look like a change.

WHAT INSTALLING THROUGH THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT GET YOU. `claude
plugin install` copies the skill folder as it stands on `main` at the
moment it runs; it does not read a release statement and it cannot be made
to. The minisign chain in this repository covers `v1/index.json`, which is
the CATALOG INDEX, and it does not cover the copy the CLI made: no
signature artifact is written into the plugin cache and nothing there is
checked. A user who wants the bytes a publisher actually signed installs
through the app's catalog screen, which verifies the index against a
pinned key and checks the folder digest before it stages anything. Both
paths are real and neither is oversold here.

A NAME COLLISION IS REFUSED, NEVER RENAMED. A marketplace namespace is flat:
`sme@carnivore` names one plugin. Two publishers shipping a skill of the same
name cannot both have it. Renaming the older one to settle the clash would
break every install that already used its name, and dropping one would make a
published skill silently absent, so the build stops and says which two clash.
