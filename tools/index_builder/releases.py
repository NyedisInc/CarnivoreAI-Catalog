"""Release statements, and the only reason this job will list a version.

THE WHOLE SECURITY OF THE CATALOG IS IN THIS FILE. Everything else assembles
JSON. This is where a version is either proven or refused, and it is proven
against the repository's own git history rather than against anything the
contributor wrote down.

WHY THE STATEMENT LIVES OUTSIDE THE SKILL FOLDER. The statement names the
folder's digest. If it lived inside the folder it would be part of what is
being digested, and no digest could ever be correct: the file changes the
number it is trying to state. So releases live at
``releases/<handle>/<name>/<version>.json`` and the skill folder stays
exactly what gets installed.

WHAT ONE RELEASE FILE HAS TO SURVIVE, IN THIS ORDER:

1. It parses, and every field has the shape it claims.
2. The statement text it carries is EXACTLY the bytes these fields render
   to. A genuine statement for skill A pasted into a file that names skill B
   fails here, before any cryptography runs, so the log says "this is not
   the statement these fields name" rather than "bad signature" and sends
   the reader to the right place.
3. The signature verifies under an ACTIVE key belonging to THAT handle. Not
   any key in the repository: the handle's own. A key that is not the
   handle's cannot release under the handle's name.
4. The commit it names is in this repository and is an ancestor of HEAD.
   A commit that exists only on somebody's fork or on a closed pull request
   is not history this repository is willing to publish.
5. The folder at that commit, checked out and re-digested with the app's OWN
   digest function, produces the digest the statement signed.

Any one of those failing refuses the version. There is no partial listing
and no "list it as unverified": an unverified version in the index is a
version somebody will install.
