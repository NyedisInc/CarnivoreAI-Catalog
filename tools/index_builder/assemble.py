"""Turn a proven repository into the index document, and nothing more.

This module does no cryptography of its own. Every version it lists has
already survived :mod:`index_builder.releases`, and every revocation it
carries has already been checked against the publisher's own key. What is
left is arrangement: grouping versions into items, deciding which one is
``latest``, and writing the exact wire shape the app parses.

TWO ORDERING RULES, BOTH DELIBERATE. Items and versions are sorted, and the
sort is total, because two builds of the same commit must produce the same
bytes: an index whose field order wandered would be a different document to
sign every time and nobody could tell a rebuild from a change. And
``latest`` is the highest VERSION rather than the newest commit, because a
fix published for an old line must not become what everybody installs.

AN UNVERIFIABLE REVOCATION FAILS THE BUILD. The app ignores one, because it
is reading a document from a server and a forged revocation that stuck would
be permanent. This job is reading its OWN repository under CODEOWNERS, where
the dangerous direction is the other one: a revocation quietly dropped here
leaves a version somebody already decided was bad sitting in the index,
installable.
