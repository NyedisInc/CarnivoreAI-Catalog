"""The quality grade: what the published specification actually requires.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO BE. Every version in the index carries a
grade of its own text and structure, written at publish time beside the AI
security review. The two answer different questions. The review asks whether a
skill does anything damaging. The grade asks whether a skill is BUILT the way
the Agent Skills specification says to build one, so an agent can find it, load
it, and follow it. Neither is a gate. A low grade never blocks a publish: what
a publisher ships is the publisher's business, and the grade is advisory in
exactly the sense the review is.

EVERY RULE CITES A PUBLISHED SOURCE OR IT DOES NOT EXIST. :data:`RULE_SOURCES`
maps every ``rule_id`` this module can emit to the URL it came from and the one
line that URL states. There is no rule in this file that is not in that table,
and :mod:`tests.test_grade` fails the build if one appears. That is the whole
discipline here: a grader that invents a rule is a grader that marks a
specification-conformant skill down for the author's taste, and the author of
this file does not get a vote.

"NOT GRADED" IS A FIRST CLASS ANSWER, exactly as the review's ``unavailable``
is. A rule that only applies when an optional field is present is reported as
not graded when that field is absent, never as a pass. A folder with no
readable ``SKILL.md`` grades as ``ungraded`` rather than as an ``F``: an F is a
measurement and this is the absence of one. A blank grade must never read as a
clean one.

IT READS THE FOLDER IT WAS HANDED AND NOTHING ELSE. Every read goes through
:func:`_read_text` and every path is resolved through :func:`_within`, which
refuses anything that leaves the folder. A body that links ``../../etc/passwd``
is reported as a reference that does not resolve, and the file is never opened.
The grade runs over a publisher's own text, so the text gets no reach.

NO MODEL IS CALLED. The grade is a pure function of bytes on disk, so it is
reproducible, it costs nothing, and two builds of the same commit produce the
same grade. Where the specification asks for a judgement a machine cannot make,
this module either uses a stated, documented proxy and says it is one, or it
declines to grade at all.
