"""catalog.yml: the handful of settings the build job is allowed to read.

WHY A FILE AND NOT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES. Every value here changes what
gets PUBLISHED, so every value belongs in the diff of a reviewed commit
under CODEOWNERS rather than in a repository setting one account can change
without a pull request. The variables the workflow does read from the
repository settings are the ones that name WHERE things go (the AWS role,
the region, the Amplify app), never what goes in them.

ABSENT IS NOT A DEFAULT for the one value that cannot be guessed. A missing
``min_serial`` is an error, because the serial floor is a rollback control
and a zero invented here would silently lower it.

      shows the index as degraded. Carried here so the two sides can be
