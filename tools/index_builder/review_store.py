"""A review committed beside the release it describes, and what binds it there.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The security review costs a model call, and until now every
call was made at BUILD time: the job read the live index, carried forward a
review whose digest still matched, and called the model for everything else.
That works, but it puts the spend on the wrong side of the decision. Adam's
ruling of 2026-09-16 is that APPROVAL is what triggers the AI work, so a
submitted skill sits in a bucket until a human approves it, the scan runs
ONCE against the bytes being approved, and the result is committed. This
module is the committed half of that, and it is useful on its own: the build
now reads a review it already paid for instead of buying it again.

A REVIEW IS BOUND TO A DIGEST, NEVER TO A VERSION STRING. The artifact
carries the digest of the folder it actually read, and a build refuses to
reuse one whose digest is not the digest of the version being built. A
version string can be moved onto different bytes; a digest cannot. A review
of different bytes is not a review of these bytes, and publishing it as one
would put a model's description of a skill nobody is installing above the
skill somebody is.

A MALFORMED ARTIFACT IS ABSENT, NEVER TRUSTED. Every way this file can be
wrong, an unparseable file, a warning kind outside the closed list, a missing
summary, a digest that is not a digest, returns None and says in the job log
WHICH file and WHY. It never half reads one. The consequence of absent is a
model call, which is the safe direction; the consequence of trusting a broken
one is a security review the app renders that nothing stands behind.

AN UNAVAILABLE COMMITTED REVIEW IS NOT REUSED, for the same reason
``review.existing_review`` does not reuse one from the live index: a review
that could not be obtained is a transient failure, not a verdict, and
freezing one into the repository would mean those bytes were never reviewed
again. So the build retries it. The status is still WRITTEN when a writer
records one, because recording honestly that a scan failed is the point of
having the value at all.

WHY IT IS NOT UNDER ``releases/``. ``releases.find_release_files`` globs
``releases/*/*/*.json`` and every file it finds must verify as a signed
release statement. A review file dropped in that tree would be read as a
release, fail to parse as one, and refuse the entire build. So the artifact
mirrors that tree one level out, at ``reviews/<handle>/<name>/<version>.json``,
which keeps the pairing obvious without putting an unsigned file inside the
set of signed ones.
