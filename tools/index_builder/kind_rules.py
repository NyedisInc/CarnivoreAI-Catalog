"""Which kind a folder is, and the rules that kind holds it to.

THE KIND IS THE MANIFEST THAT IS PRESENT: exactly one of ``SKILL.md``,
``theme.json`` and ``.claude-plugin/plugin.json`` at the folder root. A
loadout manifest is refused (this catalog publishes no loadout through
the submission rules) and so is a folder with none or several.

THIS IS A PORT OF THE HOSTED VALIDATORS in the product repository
(``hosted/catalog/api/validate_kinds.py``, ``validate_theme.py``,
``validate_plugin.py`` and the skill half of ``validate_upload.py``), on
the same order of checks: kind, name, paths and caps, then the kind's own
rules. ``tests/fixtures/kind_vectors.json`` is the one vectors file both
run, pinned by sha256 on both sides, so the two cannot drift silently.

WHERE EACH HALF IS USED. ``verify_release`` runs the theme and plugin
rules over the folder AT THE SIGNED COMMIT, so a theme or plugin nobody
would accept from the front door cannot be signed into the index by hand
either. The skill rules are here so the same vectors cover all three
kinds and the batch tool can gate a skill submission; a skill release
already in this repository keeps its own gates (the review, the grade),
because Adam's own skills legitimately carry scripts.

Pure over plain values, except ``load_folder`` which reads a directory.
