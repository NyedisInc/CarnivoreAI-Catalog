"""Who may publish, and which key the index signature must be under.

TWO DIFFERENT FILES, TWO DIFFERENT JOBS. ``publishers/<handle>.json`` says
which keys a publisher signs releases with; the build job verifies a release
statement against those and against nothing else. ``publishers/_index.json``
pins the key the INDEX is signed with, which the signing job checks its own
output against before anything is deployed.

AN EMPTY KEY LIST IS AN HONEST STATE, NOT AN ERROR. Adam generates the
keypairs himself and pastes the public halves in; an agent never holds a
private key. Until a handle has a key, its items are assembled and listed as
UNTRUSTED rather than hidden, which is the same posture the app takes for a
key it has not pinned: hiding them teaches nobody anything.
