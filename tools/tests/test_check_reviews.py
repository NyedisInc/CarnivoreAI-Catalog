"""The publish gate: a version publishes only with a review of its own bytes.

THE HOLE THESE TESTS CLOSE. The approval pull reviews the bytes it stages
and refuses to print the publish command on a blocked verdict, and the
committed artifact it writes is bound to the digest of those bytes. An
operator who edits the folder AFTER that review and commits gets bytes with
no committed review for them, and the build's own review of those bytes
wrote a verdict into the index without ever gating on it. So unreviewed
bytes published.

Every case here is a case the gate has to REFUSE, plus the two it has to
let through, because a gate that only ever says yes and a gate that only
ever says no are equally useless and look identical from a green run.

NO MODEL IS CALLED ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, and none can be: the command
under test holds no key and imports no caller. That is the point of it
running in the verify job on a stranger's pull request.
