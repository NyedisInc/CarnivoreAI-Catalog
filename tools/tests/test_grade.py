"""The quality grade, one case per rule, each proven able to go red.

THE GREEN CASES ARE WORTH NOTHING ON THEIR OWN. A grader that returns "A" for
everything passes every happy path test ever written, so every rule below is
exercised twice: once against a fixture that violates it, and once against one
that does not. That is the failure shape this repository has been bitten by
most often, and it is the reason the file is laid out in pairs.

THREE CLAIMS BEYOND THE RULES THEMSELVES:

1. A folder with no SKILL.md grades as UNGRADED, never as an F. An F is a
   measurement; a missing file is the absence of one, and collapsing the two
   would publish a verdict nobody took.
2. THE SOURCE TABLE COVERS EVERY RULE THE GRADER CAN EMIT, and the grader can
   emit every rule in the table. That is the drift test: a rule added without
   its citation, or a citation left behind by a deleted rule, fails the build.
3. THE GRADER READS THE FOLDER IT WAS HANDED AND NOTHING ELSE. A body that
   links out of the folder is reported as a reference that does not resolve,
   and the file it names is never opened. Proven by watching every read.
