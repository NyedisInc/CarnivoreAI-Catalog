"""The eleven fixture skills, and the verdict each one has to produce.

WHY THIS FILE IS THE DELIVERABLE THAT MATTERS. Before this change the
reviewer had returned zero findings on every input it had ever seen, which
is what a working detector and a broken one both look like. A green check
must first prove it can go red, so this file holds one hostile skill per
finding kind, and each one is run through the real parser and the real
verdict derivation.

NO MODEL IS CALLED HERE. The answers are canned, because what is under test
is the half that has to be deterministic: that a blocking kind produces
``blocked``, that a verdict disagreeing with its own findings is thrown
away whole, and that an answer with no verdict at all is thrown away too.
Whether the model finds the thing is a separate question, answered by
running these same folders past the live endpoint by hand; the prompt drift
guards are in ``test_review_prompt.py``.

THE FOLDERS ARE REAL AND THEY ARE THE CORPUS. ``fixtures/review/<name>/``
holds each skill as text, so the same set can be handed to the live model
when somebody changes the prompt. They live under the test tree and NEVER
under ``skills/``, so nothing here is ever published.
