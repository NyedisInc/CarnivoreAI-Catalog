"""The workflow file itself, checked the way a reviewer would check it.

A build job that signs things is part of the product. These assertions are
the ones a supply chain review asks for, written down so nobody has to
remember them during a hurried change:

- every ``uses:`` is a 40 hex commit sha, with the version in a comment. a
  tag is a mutable pointer and trusting one trusts whoever can move it.
- ``pull_request_target`` appears nowhere. it runs the base branch's workflow
  with a real token against a fork's code, which is the standard way a public
  repository hands its secrets to a stranger.
- the top level permissions are the two this needs and no more.
- there is a concurrency group, because two runs racing would read the same
  live serial and both publish it.
- no job that can run from a pull request touches a cloud role.
