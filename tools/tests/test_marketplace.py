"""The Claude plugin marketplace file, held to the schema the CLI reads.

THE SCHEMA IS NOT GUESSED HERE. Every required field asserted below is the
one documented at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces, read
on 2026-09-15 against Claude Code 2.1.266: the file lives at
``.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`` in the root of the repository that was
added, the document requires ``name``, ``owner`` and ``plugins``, and each
plugin entry requires ``name`` and ``source``, where a same repository
``source`` is a path that MUST begin with ``./`` and resolves against the
marketplace root rather than against the ``.claude-plugin`` directory.

The single skill shape this generator emits is documented at
https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference under Skill Discovery: a
plugin directory holding a ``SKILL.md`` at its root, no ``skills/``
subdirectory and no manifest loads as one skill. It was also proven against
the real CLI before this generator was written; ``claude plugin details``
reported ``Skills (1)`` for a plugin whose source was a bare skill folder.

THE REFUSALS ARE THE POINT, again. A generator that can only say yes would
happily publish a marketplace listing a skill nobody released.
