"""The card brief, and the characters it is not allowed to carry through.

A BRIEF IS COPIED VERBATIM INTO A GENERATED FILE AND RENDERED IN A LIST.
``brief_of`` flattens a publisher's description into one line, and that
line lands in ``.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`` and in the index, both
of which are printed to a terminal by tools this repository does not
control.

``" ".join(text.split())`` LOOKS LIKE IT SANITISES AND DOES NOT. Python
splits on the whitespace set, which is space, tab, CR, LF, vertical tab
and form feed. ESC, BEL and backspace are not in it. A published
description carrying ``\\x1b[31m`` therefore reached the marketplace file
intact; the consumer stripped it at render time, which is luck rather
than a guarantee, and the next consumer is under no obligation to.

A CONTROL CHARACTER IS NOT THE SAME CASE AS PUNCTUATION. An em dash is a
character the publisher meant a reader to see, so it travels. A C0
control is not text at all: it is an instruction to whatever renders it.
Removing one does not change a word the publisher wrote, which is why
this is a strip and not a rewrite.
