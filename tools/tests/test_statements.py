"""The field grammars a release statement holds its inputs to.

TWO FIELDS BECOME A PATH SEGMENT AND ALL EIGHT GET RENDERED INTO A SIGNED
LINE. ``name`` is a directory under the user's home and the flat plugin
namespace's only key; ``version`` is a file stem under ``releases/`` and
the half of a revocation subject after the ``@``. Both are read out of a
document or a filename somebody else wrote, so both are refused here or
not at all.

WHY A TRAILING DOT IS A SQUAT, NOT A TYPO. ``SKILL_NAME_RE`` used to end
``[a-z0-9._-]{0,63}$``, which accepts ``sme.`` as readily as ``sme``. A
marketplace namespace is flat and the duplicate check in
:mod:`index_builder.marketplace` compares names for equality, so ``sme``
and ``sme.`` are two different keys and the check never fires. A second
publisher could therefore ship ``sme.`` beside the real ``sme``, both
entries would be emitted, and the two rows render indistinguishably in a
list: the trailing dot reads as the end of the sentence before it. This
was not theoretical. A two publisher catalog built here emitted both, and
the live CLI installed the trailing dot source.

EVERY REFUSAL BELOW CARRIES A NEGATIVE CONTROL asserting the OLD pattern
accepted the value, so none of these tests can quietly become a test that
passes because it looked at nothing (CLAUDE.md, gotcha 11).
