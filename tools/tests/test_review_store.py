"""A committed review, and the digest that decides whether it may be used.

THE CHANGE UNDER TEST STOPPED RE-REVIEWING, NOT REVIEWING, and that
distinction is what these tests are for. Four things have to be true:

1. A committed review answers and the model is NEVER called. Proven with a
   fake that RAISES, because a fake that counted could read zero because the
   test wired it up wrong.
2. A committed review recorded against DIFFERENT bytes is ignored and the
   model runs. This is the digest binding, and it is the assertion that can
   go red under mutation.
3. A malformed committed review is ignored and the model runs. Absent, never
   half trusted.
4. With nothing committed and nothing published, the model runs, exactly as
   it did before any of this existed. This is the test that proves nothing
   became unreviewed.

No network and no api key is needed anywhere here: the model call is the one
thing that is faked, at the seam the command actually calls.
